Repository::Simple
==================

Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp, <hanenkamp@cpan.org>

This package is an attempt at creating a heirarchical database system similar to
Content Repository for Java API Specification (JSR 170), but without strictly
porting that standard. This system is written in pure Perl, but is meant to
provide an interface to low-level systems with very little effort.

If you are interested in learning more, the documentation in Repository::Simple
is the place to start. After installation, you can read it by running:

  perldoc Repository::Simple

or see the documentation online at:

INSTALLATION
